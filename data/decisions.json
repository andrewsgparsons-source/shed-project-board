      "evaluation": "**Decision: MIT License**\n\n**Key arguments:**\n- This is a niche project (garden building configurator) — unlikely anyone would profit from it more than Andrew could\n- The value isn't just the code, it's understanding timber framing, realistic dimensions, customer needs — that's Andrew's expertise\n- Someone would need to fork it, customize, host, market, handle customers — at that point they might as well build their own\n- Andrew has the head start, knows the codebase, has the business\n\n**Realistic scenarios:**\n- Someone uses it to plan their own shed ✓ (free marketing)\n- A developer learns from the code ✓ (good for reputation)\n- Someone contributes improvements back ✓ (Andrew benefits)\n- A competitor forks it — they'd still need building expertise and customer base\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is just one piece. The business is Andrew.",

      "evaluation": "**Context:**\nThe parametric system is a translation layer between craft knowledge and digital systems. The shed is proof of concept, not the limit.\n\n**Core insight:**\n\"Value-based pricing disguised as configuration\" — the configurator makes customers understand why quality costs what it costs.\n\n**Fastest path analysis:**\n\n1. **Enhanced Direct Sales** — Weeks to revenue\n   - Embed configurator on website\n   - Capture leads after design\n   - Quote faster using BOM output\n   - Minimal new build work required\n\n2. **DIY Plans** — Weeks to revenue\n   - Parametric model already generates BOM\n   - Package as PDF plans\n   - Sell to confident DIYers\n   - £49-149 per design\n\n3. **Licensing** — Months to revenue\n   - Requires productization, onboarding, support\n   - High upside but slow\n   - Risk of empowering competitors\n\n4. **Niche Builds** — Medium-term\n   - Requires market research, specialized presets\n   - But higher margins once established\n\n**The spectrum model:**\nSame parametric engine serves: Design-only → DIY kit → Assisted → Turnkey\nThis captures revenue at every price point without losing customers.\n\n**Key principle:**\n\"Bespoke but reliable\" — most builders do bespoke without systems, most systems kill bespoke. Threading this needle is the competitive advantage.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nStart with Enhanced Direct Sales + DIY Plans (fastest). Layer in niche builds and licensing over time.",
