## Quick Garden
**URL:** https://www.quick-garden.co.uk/

**Overview:**

- 350+ custom builds per year
- Range from small gazebos to 2-storey buildings

**Products:**
- Log cabins (various sizes)
- Wooden garages
- Bespoke/custom builds
- Wall thickness options available

**Configurator:** ❌ No
- Bespoke process is manual: customer sends sketch/description
- They create drawings and scale plans (free)
- Back-and-forth consultation process

**Pricing:**
- Bespoke: 10-35% premium over standard
- Example: Standard 6m×3m cabin ~£2,800, customised ~£3,100-3,500
- Different policy for 60m²+ structures

**Lead Times:**
- Custom builds: 5-8 weeks typical
- Winter/spring: ~4 weeks
- Peak summer: up to 10 weeks

**Business Model:**
- Direct sale (import + delivery)
- Free design consultation to hook customers
- Upsell from standard to bespoke

**Strengths:**
- Established, high volume (350+/year)
- Free design service lowers barrier
- Wide range from small to large
- Good SEO (found via Google Ads)

**Weaknesses:**
- No online configurator — manual process
- Long lead times
- Import model = less flexibility?
- No instant pricing

**Notes:**
- Good target to differentiate from — your configurator gives instant visualisation + pricing they can't match
- Their "free design" is your configurator's default state
